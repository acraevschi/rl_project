# Reinforcement learning agent playing Cities Skylines.

This project aims to train a deep reinforcement learning (DRL) model to play Cities: Skylines using only raw pixel data. The agent will learn to optimize city population, happiness, and income based on observed screen frames and reward signals.

ðŸš€ Current Progress

âœ… Implemented Features

- **Convolutional Neural Network (CNN):** A deep learning model is set up and running efficiently.

- **Screen Capture:** Uses multiprocessing, mss, and cv2 for real-time screen recording.

- **Keyboard & Mouse Control:** Integrated an external script for simulating key and mouse inputs on Windows.

ðŸ”¨ Work in Progress

- Reward Extraction: Developing a method to retrieve in-game metrics without relying on OCR.

- **Reinforcement Learning Loop:** Connecting the CNN with an deep RL network to estimate the policy.

- **Game State Processing:** Refining how frames and actions interact with the model.

The plan is to record my own actions and screen to create some training data for the model before actually launching it train on its own actions. Despite better performance of agents without inductive biases, I don't have the opportunity of launching multiple simultaneous game sessions at once for the model to learn to play within a reasonable time-frame.
